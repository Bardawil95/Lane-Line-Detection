# Lane-Line-Detection
System written in Python with the help of OpenCV library to detect lane lines on three-lane streets.

Requirements:-

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Scipy, OpenCV (Latest), Math and Numpy

You may use on of the videos in Dataset Folder as a test video for running the project

The system can only recognise if the vehicle is moving on the left, right or middle. It uses an intermediate level of mathematics. 
The code is well documented.

To run the code, simply type python LaneDetectionSystem.py
